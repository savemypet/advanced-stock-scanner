## 💡 **Penny Stock Trading Strategy:**

### Entry Rules:
```yaml
1. Stock shows in scanner (all filters passed)
2. Check chart for breakout confirmation
3. Wait for pullback to support
4. Enter on volume spike
5. Set TIGHT stop loss (5-7%)

Never:
❌ Chase parabolic moves
❌ Buy at the top
❌ Hold overnight (very risky!)
❌ Average down on losers
❌ Risk more than 2-5% account
```

### Exit Rules:
```yaml
1. Take 50% profit at +20-30%
2. Move stop to breakeven
3. Trail stop on remainder
4. Exit ALL before close
5. Never hold overnight (risky!)

Why Exit Before Close:
→ Penny stocks gap down often
→ Can lose 30-50% overnight
→ Day trading safer than holding
```

### Position Sizing:
```yaml
Small Account ($1,000):
→ Risk: $20-50 per trade (2-5%)
→ Position: $200-500
→ Shares: Can buy 500-10,000!

Example:
$0.50 stock, $300 position = 600 shares
If it hits $0.65 (+30%) = $90 profit
If stop at $0.465 (-7%) = $21 loss
Risk/Reward: 1:4 (excellent!)
```
