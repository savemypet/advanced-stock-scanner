✅ Big Gain (10%+ only)    = Already moving explosively
✅ Massive Volume (5x+)    = EXPLOSIVE conviction confirmed 💥

Result: Only the ABSOLUTE HOTTEST stocks qualify! 🔥💥
```

---

## 📊 **What Stocks Will You See?**

```
1. ✅ Float under 10 million shares (rare!)
2. ✅ Gained 10% or more today (explosive!)
3. ✅ Volume 5x+ average (MASSIVE!) 💥
4. ✅ Price between $1-$20 (affordable!)

If ANY criteria fails → Stock doesn't show
```

### Example of Qualifying Stock:

10% gain = Filters out noise
```

### What You WILL See:
