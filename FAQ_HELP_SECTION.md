## 🎯 **Key Questions Answered:**

### **"What are the green and red candlesticks?"**
```
Answer:
  Green = Price went UP (closed higher than opened)
  Red = Price went DOWN (closed lower than opened)
  Body = open-to-close range
  Wicks = high-low range

Visual: Clear explanation with practical examples
```

### **"What do the colored lines mean?"**
```
Answer:
  Blue Line (MA20) = 20-period average (short-term)
  Purple Line (MA50) = 50-period average (medium-term)
  Orange Line (MA200) = 200-period average (long-term)

Purpose: Trend direction, support/resistance
```

### **"What are the volume bars at the bottom?"**
```
Answer:
  Green bars = Buying volume (on up candles)
  Red bars = Selling volume (on down candles)
  Higher bars = More trading activity

Use: Confirm breakouts, spot divergences
```

### **"Why does the scanner lock with a red banner?"**
```
Answer:
  Yahoo Finance rate limits (too many requests)
  Red banner = Currently locked
  Wait 45 minutes
  Green banner = Ready to scan again

Protection: Prevents API abuse
```

### **"How do I know if a breakout is real?"**
```
Answer:
  Check 3 things:
    1. Price breaks resistance
    2. Volume spikes (2x+ average)
    3. Green candle closes above breakout

All 3 = Strong breakout!
Missing volume = Likely false

## 💡 **Example Questions & Answers:**

### **Q: "What's a Golden Cross?"**
```
A: When the MA20 (blue line) crosses ABOVE the MA50 
   (purple line), especially when both are above MA200 
   (orange). This is a strong bullish signal indicating 
   upward momentum. Look for this on the 24h chart!

### **Q: "How do I use moving averages for entries?"**
```
A: Buy when price pulls back TO a rising MA (support), 
   then bounces with a green candle + green volume. 
   MA20 = aggressive entries. MA50 = safer entries. 
   MA200 = major support. Price below all MAs = Stay out!

### **Q: "Why do timeframe switches happen instantly?"**
```
A: When the scanner runs, it fetches ALL timeframes 
   (1m, 5m, 1h, 24h) at once and stores them in memory. 
   Switching between them just swaps the data - no new 
   API calls needed! This is why it's instant.
