# 🎯 Low-Float Stock Strategy Guide

## What is Float?

**Float** = Number of shares available for public trading

```
Total Shares - (Insider Holdings + Restricted Shares) = Float
```

## Why Low Float Matters

### The Power of Low Float Stocks

**Low supply + High demand = EXPLOSIVE moves** 🚀

| Float Range | Classification | Volatility |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| < 10M | **Super Low** | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Extreme |
| 10M - 50M | **Low** | 🔥🔥🔥 High |
| 50M - 100M | **Medium-Low** | 🔥🔥 Moderate |
| 100M - 500M | **Medium** | 🔥 Normal |
| > 500M | **High** | Slow moves |

## 🎯 Your Scanner Settings (10M Float)

**Current Configuration:**
```
Max Float: 10,000,000 shares (10 million)
```

This targets **SUPER LOW FLOAT** stocks - the most volatile!

### What This Means:

✅ **Finding:** Rare, explosive movers  
✅ **Volatility:** Extreme (20-100%+ intraday swings)  
✅ **Liquidity:** Can be thin (harder entries/exits)  
✅ **Risk:** Very high (big gains OR big losses)  
✅ **Reward:** Massive upside potential

## 🎮 How to Trade Low Float Stocks

### Entry Strategy

**1. Wait for Scanner Alert**
```
Stock appears → Check criteria:
✓ Float < 10M
✓ Volume > 2x average  
✓ Gain > 10%
✓ Price action trending up
```

**2. Verify the Setup**
- Check news/catalyst
- Look at chart pattern
- Confirm volume spike
- Check bid/ask spread

**3. Position Sizing (CRITICAL!)**
```
Low float = High risk
Use SMALLER positions than normal!

Conservative: 1-2% of account
Moderate: 2-5% of account
Aggressive: 5-10% of account
NEVER: > 10% of account
```

### Exit Strategy

**Scale Out (RECOMMENDED):**
```
+10% → Sell 25% (recover some capital)
+20% → Sell 25% (lock in profit)
+30% → Sell 25% (more profit secured)
+50%+ → Sell remaining 25% (let runner go)
```

**Hard Stops (MANDATORY):**
```
Entry: $10.00
Stop Loss: $9.50 (-5%)
Never hold past stop!
```
